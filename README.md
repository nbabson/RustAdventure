## Walkthrough

The game is incomplete but the pieces that exist are functional. The
furthest one can get in the story so far is to first find the birds nest 
at the top of the wall. Then go back down and south to the promenade.
Drop everything so that you can move the statue revealing a hidden
grating. Look in the birds nest to find the hidden key, unlock the 
grating, and descend into the tunnels. Use 'help' and 'dictionary'
commands to find out what commands exist.
